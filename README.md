This package is used by the RAML Tools for .NET Visual Studio extension to generate RAML metadata from an existing Asp.Net Core implementation. 

For more info please refer to the https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-dotnet-tools[RAML Tools for .NET]

Using the extension, right-clicking your project and choosing the *Enable RAML metadata output* command will add a `RamlController`, start up configurations, a razor view and other required files (css, js, etc.).
You will find all these files in the https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-dotnetcore-apiexplorer/tree/develop/RAML.NetCoreApiExplorer/src/package/Content[package] folder.
You can check there for an example of how the functionality in this package is used.
